# OpenMotion : Inertial fusion Library

Synopsis
========

OpenMotion is an open source library written in C providing data fusion and attitude estimation algorithms. OpenMotion was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications.
A set of functions are provided in order to help one implementing its own algortithms and to compare its results.
The implemented algorithms use the output of an IMU composed by a 3D gyroscope, a 3D accelerometer and a 3D magnetometer and can be used in real-time applications on embedded systems.

Code Example
============



Motivation
==========

This opensource project aims to provide a simple and usefull way for scientists ans users to implement data fusion algorithms and to test them.
An other feature is to provide a tool for benchmarking as far as data fusion algorithms are concerned. Thus, scientists and industrials have now the possibility to achieve a scientificaly reliable performance comparison between diferent algorithms. 
On the contary of must 3D libraries, OpenMotion library has been written in C language in order to enable better portability and easier bindings like with MatLab for instance in order to run simulations.

Installation
============

Source code for OpenMotion is kept on GitHub : ***

Linux
------

Clone the GitHub OpenMotion repository :

	git clone *******

Get into the corresponding folder and create a build repository :
	
	cd OpenMotion

Then execute the "build.sh"	script which will make use of cmake in odrer to create the OpenMotion library.

	./build.sh
	
If cmake is not installed or is deprecated, you need to run the following lines before :
	
	sudo apt-get install cmake

Or :
	
	sudo apt-get upgrade

Windows
-------

First you need to install cmake : https://cmake.org/download/

Then you need to clone GitHub OpenMotion repository: *****

Create a "build" repository under OpenMotion repository.

On CMake (cmake-gui), the source code is under OpenMotion repository, the binaries are to be built under "build" repository and the generator should be MinGW Makefiles.

Then press "Generate".

Mac OS
------

API Reference
=============

**Link towards API reference docs live** :

Tests
=====

In order to test the library, a **test.c** file is provided and illustrates a basic example of its operation.

Additional functionality
========================

C functions implementing static calibration for the sensors are also provided in order to achieve the best accuracy possible for the given algorithms.

Future features and improvements
================================

An android application linked to the calibration native C functions is also provided in order to calibrate the 3D sensors (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnetometer) .
This application can also be used "as is" in others applications or projects.
