# OpenMotion : Inertial fusion Library

Synopsis
========

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains what the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)


OpenMotion is a open source library mainly aimed for real-time attitude estimation. The approach is based on data fusion technics using the output of a IMU (composed by a 3D gyroscope, 3D accelerometer and a
3D magnetometer). Among several methods proposed by the library, the user has the possibilities to choose which methods fits the best to his expectation according to its performance.

Code Example
============

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Motivation
==========

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain why the project exists.


This opensource project aims to provide a simple and usefull way for scientists ans users to implement data fusion algorithms and to test them.
An other feature is to provide a tool for benchmarking as far as data fusion algorithms are concerned. Thus, scientists and industrials have now the possibility to achieve a scientificaly reliable performance comparison between diferent algorithms. 

Installation
=============

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

API Reference
=============

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.


**Link towards API reference docs live** :

Tests
=========

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.


In order to test the library, a **test.c** file is provided and illustrates a basic example of its operation.

Contributors
============

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.


OpenMotion library is an opensource project. 

All people who want to improve, discuss or implement new functionalities are welcomed.

Here are some usefull links fot those who want to study or understand deeper the implemented algorithms :
